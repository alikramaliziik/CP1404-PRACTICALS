Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  


## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Instead of calling method classes in the class that was in them originally i can now import them and call them from another class or method

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

one of the approach i need to change is the estimate on time on task which seems i always set it low then it turns out to take more time ,my attitude is good ready to learn new techniques,i will change my approach depending on the algorithm i find better with time

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

good naming of variables which one will not confuse ,short and meaningful methods 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Set more realistic goals more so on time estimate on task,i keep setting low time which exceeds during implementations
## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

There is nothing much to be changed as my expectations are being met and that is being provided with quality examples and practice to work with and learn  ,maybe with time i will encounter something i dont like and suggest to be changed
