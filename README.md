# CP1404 Practicals

## About This Repository
This repository contains Python programs developed as part of the CP1404 subject, organized sequentially from Practical 1 to Practical 7. Each practical focuses on key programming concepts, including loops, functions, constants, exception handling, file operations, data structures (lists and dictionaries), string manipulation, CSV file handling, classes, and abstraction. The goal is to build a strong foundation in Python programming through hands-on exercises.

## About Me
I am Akram Kasozi a student at James Cook University pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. Through this repository, I am enhancing my programming skills, gaining a deeper understanding of Python concepts, and exploring algorithms and their practical implementations.

## Key Lessons on Clean Code
- **Meaningful Naming**: Using clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes (e.g., `calculate_total` instead of `ct`) improves code readability and maintainability.
- **Modular Design**: Breaking code into smaller, reusable functions and classes, as seen in Practicals 2 and 6, reduces complexity and enhances code organization.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing exception handling (Practical 3) ensures robust code by gracefully managing invalid inputs, making programs more reliable.
