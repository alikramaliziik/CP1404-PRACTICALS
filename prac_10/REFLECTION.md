# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate was mostly moderate because the hours i said i will spent doing a task,the difference was low but the actual took much time than estimate 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I started making estimates for unseen circumstances as bugs which some where persistent and allocated some time for such events

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Having an estimate help more on time management and improves ones attention and concentration because that time is running out 

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

It gives more insight and broader perspective on which i had not thought from before,it helps improve understanding and communication more

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

From reviewing others code i have been able to learn that there are different ways and algorithms to solve a problem as different people use different approaches to arrive at same solution



### Good Code Review 1

- [Dharshanaprasad](https://github.com/Dharshanaprasad/cp1404practicals/pull/4#issuecomment-3132828884)

### Explanation

This was the code review for prac 8 where its mainly about class re-use of guitar class where there is classification according to year,the code follows code principles as ensuring there is error catching and proper flow control statements

### Good Code Review 2

- [Alex-M-K-wong](https://github.com/alikramaliziik/CP1404-PRACTICALS/pull/1#issuecomment-3066672501)

### Explanation

This is a code review From prac 5 which included reading into files mostly,writing data to them and able to save,it follows proper principles as if the error checking if the file does not exist and good use of methods and classes 

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

There is nothing to change ,the quality is top notch and user friendly ,making learning enjoyable and practical

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
Use of Methods ,which makes code more maintainable ,and promotes code re use ,makes code more clear and readable another is class re use as writing car class then implementing various versions of taxis and cars under it
